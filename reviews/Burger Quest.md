# Events summary

Child Link arrives at the Hyrule Market after leaving Kokiri Forest. He is stuck there, can't go to Temple of Time (guards are investigating it) nor to Hyrule Field (the bridge collapsed) nor to the Castle (blocked by a guard). The guard blocking the path to the Castle wants a Whopper, Chicken Fries and a King Shake OREO to let Link through. Link meets an employee of the Burger King (reskinned potion shop in Market) who lost his uniform after having been attacked on the way from Kakariko to Market. The beggar is selling the uniform for 20 rupees. Link finds 19 rupees and threatens the beggar to take the 19 rupees in exchange for the uniform. With his uniform, the Burger King employee can make Chicken Fries but not a King Shake OREO. For the King Shake OREO he needs milk. Link finds a cow in the Back Alley, that is deeply sad that its significant other left it (note: the game dialogues use "it" to refer to the cow). Link talks to a man who tells him there is a special song for motivating the cow.

Link has to figure out the song based on two clues: 1) there are grass patches, a box and a guard laid out in the shape of a partition near the drawbridge 2) hidden in the cow's dialogue are hints mapping box to left, grass to right and someone to down. The song turns out to be C-Right x5, C-Left, C-Right, C-Down. Playing it reveals it is called "Whopper Whopper". Once the cow hears it, Link is given milk he promptly takes to the Burger King employee. The man is now able to make a King Shake OREO.

For the last piece of the meal, the Whopper, he needs the cow and asks Link to ask the cow to come over. The cow accepts and Link goes back to the Burger King, which is now open. Once inside, Link finds out the cow was necessary because it is the employee trained to flip burgers, and that the Whopper is made of Wolfos meat in Hyrule Burger King. The shop sells four sizes of Whopper, BK KING Fries, Chicken Fries, King Shake OREO and an empty medium soda cup for filling yourself. The employee behind the counter thanks Link for helping to get the shop running. Near the counter is the guard who was blocking the path to the castle, now with the full menu he wanted. The guard thanks Link, who can now continue his quest to the castle. He also thanks the player for playing, indicating the end of this mod!

# Review

Sorry this review is harsh but for the sake of comparing the hacks I actually need to deal black marks

**Story**: [+++] Creative and funny

Revolves around "Market now has a Burger King". Link is trapped in the Market, which is reasonably justified. The story and dialogues are genuinely funny and well-written. I think the comedy aspect comes from the gap between the absurdity of "Burger King + Zelda" and how serious/normal it looks with how the NPCs deal with it. The cow flipping burger is also a great idea, as one expects something more fatal, especially with the dialogue leading to that situation staying cleverly ambivalent.

**Gameplay**: [=] point & click like, but barren

Talk to npcs, a lot of progression-useless text (this is not a negative thing), get hints, get tasks, get and give items. This is different from typical zelda style where dialogues are more minimalistic, or at least a lot less prevalent compared to point&click, and for this reason I don't think this mod will please all zelda enjoyers. Personally I enjoy point&clicks. However there isn't much to do in this mod. There are about 20 NPCs total, excluding the haggling groups, but only 5 at most are required. Some NPCs also kept their vanilla text which I thought was disappointing.

**Map layout**: [---] Vanilla maps

All maps are vanilla, and not the most interesting ones: Market Entrance, Market, and Back Alley. Basically one big floor.

**Puzzles**: [--] Too cryptic

There is basically only one puzzle in the hack, finding the notes for the song to play to the cow. It's also somewhat nonsensical because why would the song be hidden the way it is, with random grass patches, a box and a guard on one hand, and on the other hand the cow's dialogue which isn't even a straight hint, the hint is hidden inside. IMO this leads to the player not being guided enough to make the intended use of the hints. I spent two hours on this puzzle (I was stubborn) before resorting to looking at external hints.

**Graphics** : [--] Vanilla maps, but some fast food

All vanilla OoT maps (and furthermore only prerendered ones which IMO are the ugliest maps from the base game), besides the Burger King shop (sign in market outside, and final scene inside). The final scene does rake up a few points in my eyes because it really puts the cherry on top of the joke, and the fast food items are well modeled which actually feels very rewarding.

**Overall**: [-] A very funny entry by the story/dialogue, but mediocre on other points.

I hope you keep writing for mods, and even model because it seems like you can do it based on the final scene's fast food items in the shop. I think custom maps would have gone a long way, but it would also have defeated the joke of "everything is the same but there's Burger King". I also feel like you just didn't put as much time into this as other entries may have, which is fine!
